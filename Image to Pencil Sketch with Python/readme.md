## Task 2 - Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

In this project, we have read a image in RGB format and then converted it to a pencil sketch image.
To execute the following task, I have mainly used python 'cv2' library along with other required library.
The following steps of conversion are:
1.RGB to grayscale
2.Invert of grayscale
3.Blur of inverted image
4.Invert of blurred image
5.Creating pencil sketch image of the provided RGB image using divide function
